# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new, minimal repository named `claude_code` containing only a basic README.md file. The repository appears to be in its initial state with no package.json, source code, or build configuration yet established.

## Current State

- This is a fresh Git repository on the main branch
- Contains only a README.md file with the project name "claude_code"
- No package management files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) present
- No source code directory structure established yet
- No build tools or development dependencies configured

## Development Setup

Since this repository is in its initial state, the first steps for development would typically involve:

1. Establishing the project type and technology stack
2. Creating appropriate package management files
3. Setting up directory structure for source code
4. Configuring build and development tools
5. Adding initial code files

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the project structure and tooling are established.
